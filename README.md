# JavaScript Functions: Basic

Everything you learn in JavaScript can be represented and remembered with a `function` you create. The goal of this project is to create an interactive library of everything you've learned.

## Step 1: Fork and clone this app

## Step 2: Add JavaScript functions to your library

Add functions to the `functions.js` file.

Add a new column to `index.html` by copying and pasting everything between and including `<!-- start column -->` and `<!-- end column -->` editing the **function name**, its **description**, and its **inputs**.

### List of functions
